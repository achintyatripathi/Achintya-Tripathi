                  <strong>7<sup>th</sup> July 2020 - 28<sup>th</sup> July 2020</strong> - Introduction to Machine Learning <br>
                  We started with basis of stastics and maths that will be required for
                  starting with Machine Learning. <br>
                  We wrote python scripts from scratch to understand basics of stastics and
                  Linear Regression along with Lasso and Rigid Regression . <br>

                  <strong>28<sup>th</sup> July 2020 - 3<sup>rd</sup> Aug 2020</strong> - Model Evaluation and Selection<br>
                  After learning about the basics and implementing Linear Regression we learned more about Model Selection
                  using confusion matrix, bootstrap method. and other test like z-test,t-test, ROC  etc.<br>

                  <strong>4<sup>th</sup> Aug 2020 - 25<sup>th</sup> Aug 2020</strong> - Unsupervised Learning<br>
                  After supervised learning we moved to Unsupervised Learning and learned about clustering techniques.
                  We learned about K-means clustering,DBSCAN,Hierechial clustering,etc and validating it with 
                  elbow curve, Silhoutte score.<br>

                  <strong>26<sup>th</sup> Aug 2020 - 15<sup>th</sup>Sep 2020</strong> - Text Analysis<br>
                  We learned about how NLP playes an important role in Text Analysis. We also learned about different 
                  vectorizers Glove vectorizers, Word-to-Vec, and how to create one from cosine similarities or tf-idf vectorizers.

                  <strong>16<sup>th</sup> Sep 2020 - 15<sup>th</sup>Oct 2020</strong> - Recommender Systems
                  So after 2 months into the internship we started with solving real-world problems. 
                  We formed groups of 3-4 people and created a News Recommender Systems where everything had to be done from scratch.
                  The data had to collected using Web scraping, then decide the pipeline for how we are going to tackle this problem.
                  And also do the POC about which all algorithms to include while create a recommender and how to accomodate the users also.
                  We had been tasked with the job of building two intelligent bots.<br>
                  1.The article recommender: This bot selects articles to serve a user. Inputs to the bot is the corpus of
                  new articles and a user profile if available.<br>
                  2.The user profiler: Once the user starts consuming news stories, (s)he leaves behind a clickstream of the form below:<br>
                  The bot must extract user interests from such data that can then be used for further personalisation for (her)his news feed.<br>
                  <br><br>
                  The ultimate objective is to increase clickthrough and the frequency with which the user opens the app to consume stories.
                  However, the objective in the first visit is to:<br>
                  Reduce bias in data collection (Example Bias: Stories that get served often and ranked higher, have a higher likelihood
                  of being consumed (obtaining a clickthrough))<br>
                  Learn as much as possible about the users on their first visit Maximise coverage of the news corpus

                <li>
                  <strong> Oct 2020 - Dec 2020</strong> - We started with our major project i.e. Dashboard for Proactive Policing Project. 
                  The work on the Dashboard kept on moving with other case studies and projects we did during the internship.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Oct 2020 - Dec 2020</strong> - BitCoin stock market data scraping <br>
                  This was another side project which few interns voluntereed where we had to select a bitcoin exchange and 
                  try scraping trade book data, kline data etc, using websockets and api's provided the exchange.
                  we had regular meetings other than the general meeting with out project mentors and session mentors.
                  Nothing more can be shared but it was a great experience as we learned more about python to collect data 
                  and exception handeling and how to counter real world problem that occures while collecting data.

                  <strong>16<sup>th</sup> Oct 2020 - 20<sup>th</sup>Oct 2020</strong> - Graph Analysis  
                  We got a master class about Graph Theory and how to use Neo4j
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>21<sup>th</sup>Nov 2020 - 20<sup>th</sup>Dec 2020</strong> - Neural Networks
                  We started with the basics of NN's and then moved to CNNs and had few masters from Gurcharan Singh Jr. Data Scientist at Sabudh 
                  Foundation. 
                  <br>
                  <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/achintyatripathi/speech-recognisation-mlp" target="_blank">Frame Level Speech Recognition with Neural Networks</a> -- <br>
                  Your job is to identify the phoneme state label for each frame in the test data set. 
                  It is important to note that utterances are of variable length. We are providing you 
                  code to load and parse the raw files into the expected format. For now we are only
                  providing dev data files as the training file is very large
                  <br>
                  And then on RNN from Dr. Paritosh how gave a master class on how to use RNN for time-series Analysis and 
                  tensorflow advance to use GRU, and LSTM and different type of RNN one can use.

                  "Interning at Sabudh Foundation was a great experience.I can to learn about so many new technologies.As well as 
                  learning about how important maths and stastics are in the feild of ML/DS. This oppurtunity gave me a new 
                  perspective on how we can use ML/AI for betterment of the society."
